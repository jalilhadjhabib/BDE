# Web Project - CESI EXIA 2nd Year

This GitHub repository holds the work done during my second year of Computer Science studies at CESI EXIA School as part of a web development project.

## Project Context

Our Student Office (BDE) wants a website worthy of a computer engineering school to mainly manage event promotions and an online store. The key actors will be, of course, the members of the BDE, but also the students and some CESI employees. The aim is to facilitate the organization and communication of events within the school, and to offer members goodies in the BDE's image.

The objectives include:

- Allowing students to register for activities proposed by BDE members.
- Access the list of activities proposed by the BDE members and register for one or more of them.
- Add photos to past events for which I was registered.
- Comment and like photos of a past event.
- Manage an online store where BDE members can add, delete products with a name, description, and price, classified by categories.

We developed this project using various technologies including PHP, HTML/CSS, Laravel, SQL, and JavaScript.

## Repository Content

This repository includes:

- The project report, detailing our approach and techniques used.
- Codebase for the web application.
- SQL scripts for setting up the database.
- Front-end designs and wireframes.
- Unit tests to validate the functionality of the application.
- Legal considerations for the application, such as a page dedicated to "legal notices" containing all mandatory information, and a window informing the user of the purpose of cookies.

This project was a significant first step into web development, testing not only our technical skills but also our teamwork and project management capabilities.

## Team Members

**BADANI Shoukry**: Team leader, responsible for task distribution and coordination.

**HADJHABIB Jalil**: Contributed despite being new to Laravel, learned while performing tasks and advancing the project.

**KANOUN Karim**: Despite time constraints and having to catch up on missed courses due to an accident, contributed significantly with the help of the team.

## Conclusion

This project was very enriching for us three and allowed us to discover how to create a website and work in a coordinated group. We're a bit sour due to the lack of work and non-presence of two group members.
